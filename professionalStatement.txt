I am driven to learn more about the field of cybersecurity and enjoy creating solutions that positively impact organizations and the people they serve. I am passionate about learning the tools and systems that will allow me to thrive in this field. I am committed to professionalism, and offer potential employers a wide range of experience in the private security industry, military, as the team security champion in a software environment, and as a developer.

A career in cybersecurity interests me because of the opportunities for learning technical skills in a field that is both critical, and continually expanding. I'm interested in learning about networks, and offensive and defensive techniques that help secure critical digital infrastructure. I hope to make valuable and impactful contributions as a cybersecurity analyst, and contribute to organizational resilience.
